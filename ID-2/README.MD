Question:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


Solution:
One simple solution is to generate all the fibonacci numbers and for each number check for its parity, if it is even, then add that term with 
the running sum. Do the same until sum arosses 4 million. 

Avanced solution: 
Every third term in fibonacci is even, as from basic of mathematic we know that odd + even = odd and odd + odd = even. Two concecutive Odd term provide a Even term. We will write a function that will take two parameters, first parameter is last tem w.r.t. second parameter. Second parameter is the Even term in the series.
x1, x2 - x1 previous term w.r.t. the even term x2.

x2 + next(x2 + (x1 + x2), ( x1 + x2 ) + ( x2 + (x1 + x2) ));
 = x2 + next (2 * x2 + x1, 2 * x1 + 3 * x2);
